## Tech Stack
- React Hooks and Router: It's a JavaScript library for building user interfaces created by Facebook.
- Jest, testing-library and Cypress: I really care for testing, that's why tons of specs and suites are created for testing my app. You can find some cool unit and end-2-end tests developed with Jest, testing-library and Cypress.
- Webpack: It's an open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is primarily built for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets like HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding plugins are included.
